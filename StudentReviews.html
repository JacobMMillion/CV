  <h3>
      Intro to Java / Python:
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first half of this course establishes some computer science basics: data types, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, and functions.
    In the second half, object oriented programming principals become the focus: exploring classes and
    touching on topics such as inheritance. This course provides a solid foundation for any student looking to begin learning Java or Python and covers important computer science concepts.

  <h3>
      Game Logic with Unreal Editor:
    </h3>
    <p>
    This course begins with an introduction to the Unreal Editor interface. After the student are comfortable with the interface
    as well as importing static meshes to use in their game, we shift to the main focus of the course: the blueprint system. This 
    system allows us to create the logic for our game by combining pre-made C++ code blocks. A short amount of time is spent
    explaining C++, but we mainly abstract this away to focus on the higher level logic. The students create various short projects 
    where they must create moving platforms, enemies which cause damage, a GUI, and various forms of enemy movement logic.

    <h3>
      Intro to Roblox Game Programming in Lua:
    </h3></em>
    <p>
    This course begins by looking at the definition of an algorithm,
    creating some pseudocode, and then translating it into Lua code. The students learn data types, variable declaration, conditionals,
    loops, and critical thinking skills. After they have established enough of these basics, we move to Roblox Studio. Here, the students
    can create scripts in Lua for logic within their Roblox Game. This is better suited for younger students or students with very little programming experince.

        <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was a great instructor and was very in-depth when explaining and always answered every question we had! He brought energy to every session and made me excited to learn more about the program. He also took time away from class to gather more materials and information [when we had very specific questions] about Unreal Engine to show us in class the next day, as well as helped all of us outside of class hours to make sure our problems were fixed and that we understood everything. He was an incredible, professional, and helpful instructor."

        <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very encouraging when [my daughter] had ideas. After class, in his spare time, he researched answers to her questions [when they went beyond the confines of the curriculum]. He taught extra above and beyond the curriculum as she was already ahead."

        <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very detailed and showed several examples of what was being taught, to make sure we understood... If we had questions, he'd take time to walk us through his examples and code, pointing out how different code could be used to achieve similar results. Class was a lot of fun; he was a great teacher!"
