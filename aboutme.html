                    I have instructed various computer science courses as an independent contractor for JRCoder, CodingForYouth, and LearningLand. I have also independently tutored students in computer science topics, programming, and mathematics. I have a few videos posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jacobcodesthings" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. I believe that education and educating are extremely important pursuits.

                    <strong>Here are a few kind words that have been said regarding my work:</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was a great instructor and was very in-depth when explaining and always answered every question we had! He brought energy to every session and made me excited to learn more about the program. He also took time away from class to gather more materials and information [when we had very specific questions] about Unreal Engine to show us in class the next day, as well as helped all of us outside of class hours to make sure our problems were fixed and that we understood everything. He was an incredible, professional, and helpful instructor."
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very encouraging when [my daughter] had ideas. After class, in his spare time, he researched answers to her questions, teaching extra above and beyond the curriculum, as she was already ahead."
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very detailed and showed several examples of what was being taught, to make sure we understood... If we had questions, he'd take time to walk us through his examples and code, pointing out how different code could be used to achieve similar results. Class was a lot of fun; he was a great teacher!"
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Super fun instructor and went into detail about everything we had questions about."
