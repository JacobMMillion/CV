      <em
        >I created Menuly in order to attempt to minimize an issue I noticed
        during my time working in the service industry: unorganization. Most of
        the time, menu descriptions are stored on something such as a google
        doc. The goal of Menuly is to allow managers to easily make changes to
        the menu descriptions, and to allow servers an easy interfance to
        referance and study. While further implementation is needed in order to
        fully realize this goal, the general structure of Menuly has put
        together.</em
