	    <p>
	      I am interested in the ways in which technology and thoughtful problem solving can contribute to
	      addressing intricate challenges.
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      I am a self-starter seeking a challenging opportunity in a development
	      environment. I am experienced with various languages including Python, Java, Swift, and C, databases such as Firebase, IDEs such as VScode and XCode, and version control systems such as git. I am open to both front and back end roles and have IOS app development experience (my app Menu-ly is available on the App Store).

	<h2><em>Interests</em></h2>
	    I am interested in efficient and impactful solutions to problems. I have
	    been invloved in various organizations such as <em>Rebuilding Together</em>,
	    where I assisted in the implementation of home repairs. I have also
	    participated in groups such as Columbia's<em>
	      Arete Effective Altruism Fellowship</em
	    >, a discussion group that explored ideas in Effective Altruism and
	    actionable ways to improve the world. Main topics consist of cause-areas
	    such as climate change, nuclear security, and AI safety.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    I enjoy digital photo editing and have experience with platforms such as
	    Photoshop and Lightroom. I was the first place contender in my district for
	    the <em>Congressional Art Competition</em>
	    in 2018, and my piece, "Together" was displayed in the U.S. Capital for the
	    duration of the year. More info here:

	    <b>Menu-ly,<em> IOS Application</em></b>: Menu-ly is an IOS application built with Swift designed to improve restaurant organization and customer satisfaction. Restaurant administration and management can upload their menu descriptions so servers can have easy access to view new dishes, changes, and allergies. Staff can also study with built in review features such as flashcards. Multiple restaurants have reported increased server confidence and knowledge after using Menu-ly. More information <a href="Menuly.html">here</a>

	    <b>Web Server,<em> C Program</em></b>: This basic web server can serve static HTML and
	    image files and is also capable of serving dynamic content by working in conjunction with
	    a database server using sockets API. Implemented to support GET requests
	    (C).
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <b>WGET Clone,<em> C Program</em></b>: This program takes the host, port
	    number, and file path of a web page as input. It opens a socket connection, and requests
	    the given file using HTTP 1.0 protocol. On success, the requested file is
	    downloaded (C).
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <b>Droid Invasion Game,<em> Python Application</em></b>: In this game, the user control a lightsaber at the bottom of the screen that

	    and box. This tactic is applied until all cells in the board are solved
	    (Assembly).
