      I am interested in the ways in which technology can contribute to
      addressing intricate challenges.
      <br />
      I am a self-starter seeking a challenging opportunity in a development
      environment.

    <p>
      <em>May 2023 - August 2023</em>: Instructed various computer science
      courses as an independant contractor for JRCoder and CodingForYouth.
      Classes included: object-oriented programmaming in Java, designing game
      logic with blueprints in the Unreal Editor, and Roblox game programming in
      Lua. This link contains more information on my teaching experience as well as various student/parent
      <a href="StudentReviews.html">reviews</a>
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3><em>Skills</em></h3>
    <em>Languages</em>: C, Java, Python, Assembly
    <br />
    <em>Technologies</em>: Git, Unreal Editor, Roblox Studio

    <br />
    <br />

    <h3><em>Projects</em></h3>
    <em>Menuly</em>: Menuly is an IOS application created in order to allow
    servers to have an easy to use application that they can use to reference
    menu descriptions, as well as study with the built in flashcard page
    (Swift). Multiple restaurants have reported increased server confidence and knowledge after using Menu-ly. More information <a href="Menuly.html">here</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Web Server</em>: Created a web server that can serve static HTML and
    image files, as well as serve dynamic content by working in conjunction with
    a database server using sockets API. Implemented to support GET requests
    (C).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Web Page Downloader</em>: Created a program that takes the host, port
    number, and file path of a web page, opens a socket connection, and requests
    the given file using HTTP 1.0 protocol. On success, the requested file is
    downloaded (C).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Droid Invasion Game</em>: In this game, you control a lightsaber that
    must deflect bullets shot from waves of incoming droids. The game ends when
    a droid reaches the bottom of the screen before the character can destroy
    them (Python).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Sudoku Solver</em>: Given a pointer to an unsolved Sudoku board, this
    function solves the puzzle, iteratively applying a single solving tactic:
    for each solved cell, rule its digit out of the corresponding row, column
    and box. This tactic is applied until all cells in the board are solved
    (Assembly).

      web page downloader are private github repos as to not provide solutions
      to assignments that may be reused. I am more than happy to add

    <h3><em>Interests</em></h3>
    I am interested in efficient and impactful solutions to problems. I have
    been invloved in various organizations such as <em>Rebuilding Together</em>,
    where I assisted in the implementation of home repairs. I have also
    participated in groups such as Columbia's<em>
      Arete Effective Altruism Fellowship</em
    >, a discussion group that explored ideas in Effective Altruism and
    actionable ways to improve the world. Main topics consist of cause-areas
    such as climate change, nuclear security, and AI safety.
    <br />
    <br />
    I enjoy digital photo editing and have experience with platforms such as
    Photoshop and Lightroom. I was the first place contender in my district for
    the <em>Congressional Art Competition</em>
    in 2018, and my piece, "Together" was displayed in the U.S. Capital for the
    duration of the year. More info here:
