				Learning Land Lesson Plans Development and Instruction
			</h3>
			<p class="project-description">
				Developed comprehensive lesson plans for Learning Land, focusing on making complex computer science concepts accessible and engaging for students. The lesson plans cover a range of materials, such as using the Pygame library to create games in Python. The materials can be found <a href="https://github.com/JacobMMillion/Learning_Land_Lesson_Plans" target="_blank">here</a>.

				Intro to Java / Python Instructor
			</h3>
			<p class="project-description">
				As an instructor, I taught courses that established core computer science concepts: data types, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, and functions. In the second half, we focused on object-oriented programming principles, exploring classes and inheritance. These courses provided a solid foundation for students beginning to learn Java or Python and covered important computer science concepts.

			<h3 class="project-title">
				Game Logic with Unreal Editor Instructor
			</h3>
			<p class="project-description">
				I introduced students to the Unreal Editor interface, guiding them through importing static meshes and using the Blueprint system to create game logic by combining pre-made C++ code blocks. Students created various projects involving moving platforms, enemy behaviors, GUIs, and different enemy movement logic, focusing on higher-level logic and game development principles.

		<div class="project">
			<h3 class="project-title">
				Intro to Roblox Game Programming in Lua Instructor
			</h3>
			<p class="project-description">
				In this course, I taught students the basics of programming using Lua, starting with algorithms and pseudocode and translating them into code. Students learned data types, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, and critical thinking skills. We then moved to Roblox Studio, where students created scripts in Lua for logic within their Roblox games. This course was suited for younger students or those with very little programming experience.

		<!-- Reviews -->
		<h2>Reviews</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was a great instructor and was very in-depth when explaining and always answered every question we had! He brought energy to every session and made me excited to learn more about the program. He also took time away from class to gather more materials and information [when we had very specific questions] about Unreal Engine to show us in class the next day, as well as helped all of us outside of class hours to make sure our problems were fixed and that we understood everything. He was an incredible, professional, and helpful instructor."
		</p>
		<p><hr></p>

		<p>
			<strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very encouraging when [my daughter] had ideas. After class, in his spare time, he researched answers to her questions [when they went beyond the confines of the curriculum]. He taught extra above and beyond the curriculum as she was already ahead."
		</p>
		<p><hr></p>

		<p>
			<strong>5/5 stars:</strong> "Jacob was very detailed and showed several examples of what was being taught, to make sure we understood... If we had questions, he'd take time to walk us through his examples and code, pointing out how different code could be used to achieve similar results. Class was a lot of fun; he was a great teacher!"
