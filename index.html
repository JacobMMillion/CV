    <p>
      I am interested in the ways in which technology can contribute to
      addressing intricate challenges.
      <br />
      I am a self-starter seeking a challenging opportunity in a development
      environment. I am experienced with various languages including Python, Java, Swift, and C, databases such as Firebase, IDEs such as VScode and XCode, and version control systems such as git. I am open to both front and back end roles and have IOS app development experience (my app Menu-ly is available on the App Store).

    <h3><em>Experience</em></h3>

    <p>
      <em>May 2023 - August 2023</em>: Instructed various computer science
      courses as an independant contractor for JRCoder and CodingForYouth.
      Classes included: object-oriented programmaming in Java, designing game
      logic with blueprints in the Unreal Editor, and Roblox game programming in
      Lua. This link contains more information on my teaching experience as well as various student/parent

    <h3><em>Projects</em></h3>
    <em>Menu-ly</em>: Menu-ly is an IOS application built with Swift designed to improve restaurant organization and customer satisfaction. Restaurant administration and management can upload their menu descriptions so servers can have easy access to view new dishes, changes, and allergies. Staff can also study with built in review features such as flashcards. Multiple restaurants have reported increased server confidence and knowledge after using Menu-ly. More information <a href="Menuly.html">here</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Web Server</em>: This basic web server can serve static HTML and
    image files and is also capable of serving dynamic content by working in conjunction with
    a database server using sockets API. Implemented to support GET requests
    (C).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Web Page Downloader</em>: This program takes the host, port
    number, and file path of a web page as input. It opens a socket connection, and requests
    the given file using HTTP 1.0 protocol. On success, the requested file is
    downloaded (C).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Droid Invasion Game</em>: In this game, the user control a lightsaber at the bottom of the screen that
    must deflect incoming bullets back towards waves of incoming droids. The game ends when
    a droid reaches the bottom of the screen before the character can destroy
    it (Python).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Sudoku Solver</em>: Given a pointer to an unsolved Sudoku board, this
    function solves the puzzle, iteratively applying a single solving tactic:
    for each solved cell, rule its digit out of the corresponding row, column
    and box. This tactic is applied until all cells in the board are solved
    (Assembly).

      <a href="https://github.com/JacobMMillion">github</a>. The web server and
      web page downloader are private github repos as to not provide solutions
      to assignments that may be reused. I am more than happy to add
      collaborators for viewing, please reach out with a good email address for me to
      add.</em

    <h3><em>Interests</em></h3>
    I am interested in efficient and impactful solutions to problems. I have
    been invloved in various organizations such as <em>Rebuilding Together</em>,
    where I assisted in the implementation of home repairs. I have also
    participated in groups such as Columbia's<em>
      Arete Effective Altruism Fellowship</em
    >, a discussion group that explored ideas in Effective Altruism and
    actionable ways to improve the world. Main topics consist of cause-areas
    such as climate change, nuclear security, and AI safety.
    <br />
    <br />
    I enjoy digital photo editing and have experience with platforms such as
    Photoshop and Lightroom. I was the first place contender in my district for
    the <em>Congressional Art Competition</em>
    in 2018, and my piece, "Together" was displayed in the U.S. Capital for the
    duration of the year. More info here:
